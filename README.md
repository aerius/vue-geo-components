# @aerius/vue-geo-components

Shared Vue 3 + OpenLayers geo components for AERIUS frontends. The stack is Vue 3, Vite,
TypeScript, OpenLayers 10, proj4, and Pinia.

The library is built with Vite and ships as ESM. `ol`, `vue`, `proj4`, and `pinia` are
peer dependencies: the library does not bundle them, it uses the app's own copies.

> Status: starting point. This repo sets up the build, tooling, and CI. The real map code
> comes in a follow-up. The `MapView` component and `RD` helper here are a small working
> example.

## Use it in an app

**1. Point npm at Nexus for the `@aerius` scope.** Add this line to the app's `.npmrc`:

```
@aerius:registry=https://nexus.aerius.nl/repository/npm/
```

(If reads need a login, run
`npm login --scope=@aerius --registry=https://nexus.aerius.nl/repository/npm/` once.)

**2. Install it**, plus the peer dependencies if the app doesn't already have them:

```bash
npm install @aerius/vue-geo-components
npm install ol vue proj4 pinia
```

**3. Use it:**

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { MapView } from "@aerius/vue-geo-components";
import "@aerius/vue-geo-components/style.css";
import "ol/ol.css";
</script>

<template>
  <MapView :zoom="7" style="height: 480px" />
</template>
```

`MapView` uses the Dutch RD map projection (EPSG:28992) by default. Child components can
get the map with `useMap()`.

## Use the newest build

Say an app uses this library and you want to always work against the latest version.
There are two cases:

**You are editing the library too.** Use yalc: your local library changes show up in the
app the moment you save - live, with nothing to publish. This is the fastest loop. See
[docs/local-development.md](./docs/local-development.md).

**You just want the newest published build** (you're not editing the library). Depend on
the `dev` tag in the app's `package.json`:

```json
"@aerius/vue-geo-components": "dev"
```

Every push to this library's `main` publishes a new `dev` snapshot. Pull the newest one
into the app with:

```bash
npm update @aerius/vue-geo-components
```

Each snapshot has a unique version, so this always works cleanly. The app stays on whatever
is locked in its `package-lock.json` until you run `npm update`, so `npm ci` stays
reproducible. See [docs/versioning.md](./docs/versioning.md).

## Pin a released version

For a stable build (e.g. on an app's release branch), depend on a real release number
instead of the `dev` tag:

```bash
npm install @aerius/vue-geo-components@0.2.0
```

Real releases are published to the `latest` tag from a GitHub Release - see
[docs/versioning.md](./docs/versioning.md).

## Develop this library

Use Node 24 (see [`.nvmrc`](./.nvmrc)).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # rebuild on every save
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm test
npm run build        # type-check + build dist/
```

- **Releasing and versioning:** [docs/versioning.md](./docs/versioning.md)

## What it exports

Everything comes from [`src/index.ts`](./src/index.ts):

| Export                                           | What it is                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MapView`                                        | The OpenLayers map as a Vue component. Shares the map with child components. |
| `useMap` / `provideMap` / `mapInjectionKey`      | Get or share the map instance.                                               |
| `RD` / `registerRdProjection` / `isRdRegistered` | Dutch RD map projection (EPSG:28992).                                        |
| `useMapViewStore`                                | Shared map state (center, zoom).                                             |
